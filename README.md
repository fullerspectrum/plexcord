Show what you're watching or listening to on Plex, on Discord.


What you need:
- ~~Relies on [Discord-RPC-Extension's](https://github.com/lolamtisch/Discord-RPC-Extension "Discord-RPC-Extension's") server for now. For now.~~
- Discord client ID: [set up an application here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/application "set up an application here")
- A premium Plex account, as this uses [webhooks](https://support.plex.tv/articles/115002267687-webhooks/ "webhooks").

Why: I wanted to learn how to use something. Other than that, I wanted something that worked with Kodi, mobile apps, etc. and not just the browser on the same machine.
